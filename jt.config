# name of the resulting output template
template_name: mx_config.j2

# what junos configuration stanzas should be included in output template?
# currently supports top level stanzas or keyword 'all'
template_stanzas:
  - interfaces
  - system
  - protocols

# do you want to see debug output? Useful for building new paths
debug: false

# what types of things do we need to convert to jinja2 variables.
# each instance should have a path and a name defined
# path follows curly bracket configuration stanza hierarchy
# the last element listed will be converted into a variable
# when the last element is a 'stanza' name, the name will be converted
# however, if the last element listed is a 'node', it's value will be converted
# consider the difference in 'interfaces ge-0/0/0' vs 'interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 1.1.1.1/24'
# in this case ge-0/0/0 is a stanza name and 1.1.1.1/24 is a node value.
# we can and do want to be able to convert both types
